description: "He Zike’s “E-dream: We’ll stay, forever, in this way (2020
  selected)” can be seen as a connecting portal between the real and the
  simulated. This real-time website hosts an intelligent program that constantly
  adapts stories written and broadcasted by the media. Information is then
  processed into dialogue which creates a fragmented story between Jack and
  Rose—the two protagonists of the site, whose interview with the media will
  never end."
