summary: >
  AlterHEN proudly presents "Exhibition I", an exploration of digital art
  exhibited on the blockchain by a collective of 20 international artists,
  showcasing the diversity of the NFT scene. It is the genesis exhibition of the
  group.
description: WIP Offering a variety of formats, Exhibition II is an opportunity
  for alterHEN artists to experiment in two different ways. Some artists tried
  machine learning generated images, others tested 3D scans or even the
  combination of movie soundtrack with gif animation. The big challenge of this
  exhibition was around collaboration where Bjorn Calleja invited Dennis Bato to
  co-create a series of paintings mixing their artistic practices with
  brilliance. This collaboration has been facilitated by mono8 gallery.
