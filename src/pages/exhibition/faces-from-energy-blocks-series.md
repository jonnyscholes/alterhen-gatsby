  Auni Seiva is a Brazilian artist, born in São Paulo, 1986. She started her
  trajectory in Graffiti culture, 2005. Not satisfied with just painting her
  name on walls, she seeks to establish her name as a contemporary artist
  (without limits). Ethical-existential sustainability Studies of quantum
  physics, psyche, synchronicity, mysticism (mainly oriental), and the use of
  discarded objects by the city to criticize the current society, with a
  tendency to impulsive, irresponsible and often irrational consumerism. The
  artist realizes that such lack of control is based, countless times, on an
  attempt to supply internal shortages and emptiness. 


  The collection of objects is done mainly in my bicycle trips, that's how I started this research, in the path of 36km (round trip) daily, from Guarulhos, where I lived at the time, to the Alex Vallauri Residence (FUNARTE SP). Currently her work is focused on NFTs, performance and sculptures. She is represented by the gallery "A7MA" with exclusivity of the series "Post-Graffiti"
