  We are a nature-sensitive species. In a time of high severe weather phenomena, embracing our inner connection with the natural surroundings is essential.


  Through this collaboration, Diane Drubay and SOMATICBITS created a series of AI-generated photographs composed of 220 artificial weather phenomena. The pictures are being created from dozens of breathtaking seascapes captured worldwide, then transformed into thousands of pieces to synthesize artificial landscapes, and finally recomposed as a synthetic meteorological journey. This project is inspired by the daily collective attention on weather and its impact on our lives and emotions, and how certain natural environment transforms the way we feel and think.


  For alterHEN, they are presenting abstracts of their somatic journey through 4 videos expressing the meteorological and social turbulence of today.

  David Pettersson, also known as SOMATIC BITS, is a digital artist working on interactive, immersive and generative artworks.

  A graphic designer turned creative coder, his works are trying to touch the psyche of the viewer. 

  Immersing and engulfing anyone willing to get swept away into a world of his own. 

  Making the reality twist around, and leave a permanent trace upon the mind of whoever sees his pieces. 

  From simplistic monochrome to hyper-detailed colourful artworks, he never stops trying to find ways to express his vision of life and has a constant flow of ideas and creativity. Life is made for experimenting - and it transpires into his creations.


  Diane Drubay is a visual artist working with photographs and videos to create anticipatory visions of other futures. Drawn by the aesthetics of social science fiction literature, using colour-psychology and current scientific discoveries, the speculative visions depicted by Diane Drubay advocate for optimistic images interpreting shocking stories of possible futures.

  Diane Drubay's fascination with natural light and colours started in 2012 while waiting for the golden hour in the garden of Claude Monet at Giverny. There, she captured the awakening of Nature and its changes over the months (she produced or supervised the series of videos 'Monet's Secret Garden').

  Between 2013 and 2018, she has been working on one project tracing the different stages to reach the ultimate transcendence through Nature by compiling hundreds of impressions of the rising and setting sun. This led to a final 23-minute video untitled "Odyssey" and a great number of single videos and photographs. 

  Since 2019, she is exploring natural glitches and how they impact our vision of landscapes and our imagination of the future.
