title: Shined
statement: >-
  'Shined' is a series of fading photographs of casual strangers. The people
  depicted are the artist's social network followers, who responded to her
  public call to be photographed for free (anyone who wished). The only
  requirement was to take the picture with their eyes closed.

  “The images of random models are on the threshold of detectability; crossing it, they fade - traces of the people's presence disappear into streams of light. By 'erasing' the portraits, Liza directs them to the original unknown, where they were before they met her and where they now return.” © A. Evangeli, art critic 


  Later, Liza began using this flickering method, shooting landscapes and random moments. "I want to show the passing of time by these video slides, a moment of memory that is born and then by a flash of light is going nowhere.”
