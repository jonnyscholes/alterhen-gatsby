statement: >-
  A collaboration between artists Bjorn Calleja and Dennis Bato, “Terra Ignota,”
  in partnership with Mono8 Gallery is an interrogation into an unfamiliar
  terrain where the two artists' practices intersect. The exhibition examines
  how Calleja and Bato utilize space and forms in their works to represent
  environments where identities exist. Calleja's colourful works present images
  drawn from ﬂowers, landscapes and portraits, referenced historical images,
  photos of sports events, portrayals of the imagined, and surreal scenarios.
  Thus, his works entice the audience to look more closely and allow enough
  breathing space for meaning to materialize. Calleja shows a microcosm within a
  microcosm, where images can turn into landscapes even if they do not carry the
  same visual references as expected. Hence, arranging characters who personify
  the artist’s exploration into the essence of being and the invisible
  relationships that traverse through the universe. 


  Meanwhile, Bato’s dark and monochromatic portrayals in silhouette depict human relationships and behaviour in contexts of space and time. Bato peers into this perspective, which is an exploration into the patterns of chaos. The layers in his works reveal the multi-dimensional characteristics of space: the physical and the psychic aspect where is defined by recurring events. The lines in Bato’s works converge into points where we can trace the similar paths followed by different people while the silhouette act like ghost particles of our every interaction.

  Dennis Bato


  Reality is subjective, just like a shapeshifter varying between each spectators’ perspective. Dennis Bato inquires on the connection of spatial context with human forms and perceptions. Exploring issues and imposes inquiries on social relevance, observation of the chaotic society, adapting, and how it may transcend to different modes of representations. A collection of gathered thoughts that creates an illustration of graphic truths and deceptions, often finding balance from created chaos and deconstructed forms out of our society’s norms.

  Dennis Bato (b. 1989) is a street artist who portrays current issues he observes around him. Through various materials and formats, he focuses on themes of society versus individuality. He has a constant thirst for awareness and answers, which leads lot of his research towards philosophy. As a licensed architect, he tends to push the boundaries of material experimentation in communicating ideas through his work. Bato received his BS in Architecture from the Far Eastern University. His works have been exhibited in Shanghai, Jakarta, and Manila. He is currently under the MFA program of the University of the Philippines, Diliman.
