title: portr(aa)
statement: Portr(aa) is an automated Portrait generator I'm currently building.
  it uses neural network based technique (AI) to generate colors and shapes from
  a set of input pictures. Abstraction comes from a mix of various digital image
  manipulation algorithms applied all along the process. these are early results
  from the experiment.

description: I am working in Paris as a cgi/3d artist. I’m also a photographer
  and a software developer. I started using Neural Network based Artificial
  Intelligence technology around 2015. I enjoy using optical flow analysis tools
  to capture motion from moving footage. I enjoy manipulating still digital
  images and motion sequences in a transformative/generative way. I’m building
  and using my own tools using open-sourced and custom code. I consider my work
  as transformative. I like to explore abstraction and baroque. inspiration
  comes from personal photography or friends' social media. some may come from
  the 'internet soup'.
