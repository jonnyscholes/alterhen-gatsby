  What lies within the bounds being? IntraBeing envisions enigmatic spaces
  beyond the capacities of medical imaging tools. The project employs
  MRI-acquired data to reveal alternative time scales inside the human body. 


  Joteva worked remotely with scientists at Fraunhofer MEVIS to investigate the capacities of medical imaging and simulation procedures in order to locate enigmatic spaces that emerge at the limits of their resolution and computation. 


  She conducted a series of full body MRI scans and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) scans, commonly used only to show connectivity in the brain, to instead uncover nerve fibers in the chest, pelvic and feet regions of her body. She drew inspiration from the fact that hydrogen atoms, which MRI relies on, are also in constant flux on a nano-second time-scale and thus evade precise measurement. These components are key elements in the artwork which exhibits an oscillating inner landscape of hydrogen atoms, the nerves they flow along and the magnetic potentials generated between them.

  Eli Joteva (b.1990) is a Bulgarian intermedia artist and researcher based in
  LA. With a practice rooted in photography and digital media, she is influenced
  by contemporary research in the fields of quantum mechanics, neurophysics and
  machine vision. 


  She holds an MFA from UCLA Design | Media Arts, a BA in Fine Arts from USC Roski and completed The New Normal postgraduate research program at Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design. 


  She has exhibited internationally in venues like Ars Electronica, Fischer Museum, Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Photon Gallery, SciArt Initiative, DC I/O, Culture Hub LA, FakeMeHard, Gogbot, Currents New Media, xCoax, DA Fest, Sariev Contemporary and Queensland Center for Photography. She has been a resident artist at Vermont Studio Center, ACRE, Photo+Sphere and an active member of UCLA Art Sci Center | Lab. She is currently artist in residence at STEAM Imaging III with Ars Electronica & Fraunhofer MEVIS, Professor at houdini.school, VR Gallery Director and Curator at SUPERCOLLIDER and Co-founder of current.cam.
