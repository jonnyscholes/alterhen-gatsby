statement: >
  HALO I, II and III are sequels to Camp (1998), a video which presents a cliché
  of outdoor life. Twenty-three years later, the promise of what summer brings
  has changed. 


  HALO references the significant feedback loop we are in after decades of warnings. BC is set to have the 3rd worst fire season on record, all of which occurred within the last 5 years. Simultaneously, the UN declared that it is code red for humanity as a result of climate change.


  Campfires are now banned in the summer in British Columbia (where I live). With severe, extended droughts being the new normal,  the risk of wildfire is extreme. Compounding the threat, 2021 produced record temperatures reaching a staggering 49.6C, smashing the previous record by 4.6C. It is set to be the 3rd worst fire season on record, all of which were recorded within the last 5 years. Simultaneously, the UN declared that it is code red for humanity as a result of climate change.

  Taking cues from 19th-century landscape painting, 20th-century cinema, and
  21st-century planetary research, Kelly Richardson (b. 1972, Canada) crafts
  video installations and digital prints that offer imaginative glimpses of the
  future that prompt a careful consideration of the present. 


  Her work has been widely acclaimed in North America, Asia and Europe. 


  Recent one person exhibitions include Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Austria), NGCA (England), Dundee Contemporary Arts (Scotland), SMoCA (USA), CAG Vancouver (Canada), VOID Derry (Ireland), and a major survey at the Albright-Knox (USA). 


  Her work was selected for the Beijing, Busan, Canadian, Gwangju and Montréal biennales, and major moving image exhibitions including the The Cinema Effect: Illusion, Reality and the Moving Image at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (USA). Her video installations have been included in the Toronto International Film Festival as part of Future Projections (2012), Sundance Film Festival in New Frontier (2011 and 2009) and in 2009, she was honoured as the featured artist at the Americans for the Arts National Arts Awards. Richardson’s work has been acquired into significant museum collections across the UK, USA and Canada including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (USA), SMoCA (USA), Albright-Knox Art Gallery (USA), National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Ontario (Canada), Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal (Canada), Arts Council Collection (England) and the Towner (England).

      23 years after producing ‘Camp’, the promise of what summer brings has
      changed. ‘HALO I’ presents a full, partially red moon distorted once again
      by heat rising from something burning and crackling out of shot. Embers
      float around and smoke swirls.
