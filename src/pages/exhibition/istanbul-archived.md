description: "Zeynep is an artist and curator from Istanbul, Turkey. She studied
  film and interactive media at Emerson College, later getting her start at
  LACMA’s Art+Tech lab creating AR installations. She then worked at the
  Sundance Film Festival's New Frontier Exhibitions and is a recent graduate
  from UCLA’s Design Media Arts MFA program. She primarily works with archived
  photography, video, and immersive media. Her subjects revolve around identity,
  history, and loss of memory. She is deeply influenced by Istanbul’s city
  culture and in pursuit of exploring shifting identities to navigate the
  struggle and alienation that arise from changing social environments. "
