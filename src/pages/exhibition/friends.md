title: Friends
statement: >-
  A series of video drawings Friends is a graphic story about two boys and their
  buddies. It was first shown at the exhibition "Learned Helplessness" (CCI
  Fabrika, Moscow, 2017) and was continued at the exhibition "Four Boys"
  (Afimall City, Moscow, 2019). The everyday life of teens collides in the most
  bizarre ways with Biblical stories, ancient Greek myths, and the history of
  art. The circumstances in which the main characters find themselves are both
  real and unreal, shining through them.

  Unreality is the central theme of the whole series. It alludes to the version of life that never happened to these guys and that never became their salvation.

  Dmitry Kavka (b. 1974, Moscow, Russia) is an artist and graphic designer. He
  creates projects at the intersection of digital and physical realities. The
  combination of various means of expression and media allows the artist to
  explore the paradoxes of new sensitivity, social shifts, and transformations
  of images in the digital environment. In his works, the artist uses both new
  media — digital sculptures, videos, static computer games, and more
  traditional techniques — such as graphics. He also experiments with new ways
  of representing art projects in virtual reality. For instance, in 2013 the
  artist created an online game that houses digital sculptures of the artist.

  In 2017 he presented an exhibition of drawings on Google Maps using Google Street View technology — the project was shown in Venice, during the 57th Biennale of Contemporary Art.
