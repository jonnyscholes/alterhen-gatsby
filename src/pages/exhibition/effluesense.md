artist: "Eli Joteva "
title: Effluesense
statement: "Is it possible that biological life has senses, desires and
  pulsations beyond human comprehension? Effluesense is a photography project
  that considers the agency and livelihood of organic materials and ecological
  terrains. Inspired by theories in vibrant materialism and quantum mechanics,
  the artist scans various landscapes and organic compositions with gestural
  laser-light movements in order to expose a fluctuating dimension of plant
  life. "
