statement: >-
  Architecture in Motion is a series of experiments around the notion of hybrid
  space. A questioning of the world we are experiencing here and now.

  The construction of a digital landscape fed by a multitude of data organized and processed by the machine according to a series of simple and repetitive rules. This procedural approach generates spaces and abstract architectures, the start of a new digital exploration.

  Architect and media artist Zaki Jawhari better known as URBANDRONE has been
  carrying out research since 2007 on the sensitive perception of the space. 


  His experimental approach explores the complexity of the world where the limits between virtual and physical space become blurry. He started his artistic career performing live for electronic music festivals and producing interactive digital experiences with digital slaves and solo since 2014.
