statement: >-
  In this exhibition, Tresset, following his series of Human Study #2
  installations, pursues his exploration of the Vanitas genre. 

  In contrast to the traditional Flemish manner here, the atmosphere is stark, almost grim rather than opulent. But, like all vanitas, these are about life rather than death. They express existence's ineluctability with dry underlying humour.

  Using GIFs as time-based media, where each frame is conceived as an individual artwork, these animations are experiments in stylised minimalist storytelling.

  Patrick Tresset is a Brussels-based artist who, in his work, explores human
  traits and the aspects of human experience. His work reflects recurrent ideas
  such as embodiment, passing time/time passing, childhood, conformism,
  obsessiveness, nervousness, the need for storytelling, and mark-making. He is
  best known for his performative installations using robotic agents as stylized
  actors that make marks and for his exploration of the drawing practice using
  computational systems and robots. 


  He holds a master’s degree and an MPhil in arts and computational technologies from Goldsmiths College London. Aside from his artistic practice, in 2013, he was a senior visiting research fellow at Konstanz University and is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Canberra in the robotics department. 


  His work has been exhibited in solo and group shows, including in association with major museums such as; The Pompidou Center (Paris), Prada Foundation (Milan), Tate Modern (London), V&A, MMCA (Seoul), The Grand Palais (Paris), BOZAR (Brussels), TAM (Beijing), Mcam (Shanghai), Mori Museum (Tokyo). His installations have been awarded prizes and distinctions (Lumens, Ars Electronica, NTAA, Japan Media festival). His works have featured in numerous media, including; Art press, Art review, Beaux art, Frieze, Arte, Form, Wired, Vice, BBC, DeWelle, Le monde, New York Times.
