statement: With sensori-moteur Laurent La Torpille continues his exploration in
  the fields of image and sound perception. By dematerializing reality or by
  drawing inspiration from it, he wishes, through his digital works, to offer
  another perspective. This has led him, since 1994, to create his own digital
  tools which have continued to evolve since.
