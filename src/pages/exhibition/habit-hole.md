artist: Ian Raposo
title: Habit hole
statement: "\"Habit hole\" is a window for a collection of analog collages made
  in the last few years by the artist. The act of mixing images forming new
  results it's an important part of the artist's investigation to try to
  represent issues and the difficulty of dealing with our own minds."

  Ian Raposo (1992), Rio de Janeiro resident, is a visual artist which main
  investigative practice happens through painting. In his work, from an early
  age, the influence of the punk aesthetic is evident due to his personal
  connection with the subculture of underground music. In his drawings,
  collages, prints and paintings inhabit an imagery repertoire that allows the
  development of a transmutable graphic thought for the virtual environment of
  NFT's.
   "The work itself is a mixture of irony, bad mood and dissatisfaction. Ian proposition is to  develop a research in art on the discomfort of the individual facing the ways of life imposed by the contemporary city."
