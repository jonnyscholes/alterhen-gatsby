artist: Videophonic Workshop
title: Excerpts from 1987 Series and Waveform Series
statement: Both the 1987 Series and the Waveform Series evoke the
  “oscillographic surrealism” of x/y scan processing. Emerging from the ghostly
  darkness in three dimensions, these futuristic sketches draw on the techniques
  of early digital video art pioneers to create 3-bit patterns and animation
  (1987 Series) and single-axis waveform manipulations (Waveform Series) and
  elicit the “dream states of futures past”. Captured in 4k UHD and frame rates
  ranging from 12fps to 60fps.

  individual perceptions. He is the artistic director and co-founder of
  brokenorchestra.org as well as the owner and co-founder of the DUMBO
  audio/visual workshop The Honey Jar. He has worked with artists such as Sufjan
