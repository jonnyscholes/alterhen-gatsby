title: Come What May Not
statement: >-
  "The motifs of all the works are based on internal mythology, but at the same
  time, there are some references to the folklore of the Russian North, which
  inspires me. 

  I am attracted by the aesthetics of the terrible and the funny, as it is impossible to live without fun, knowing that life is finite" - Ulyana Podkorytova
