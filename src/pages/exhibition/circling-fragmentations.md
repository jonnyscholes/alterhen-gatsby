title: Circling Fragmentations

statement: >-
  Tracing the soft edges of paper tears with fingertips. Drawing up the shapes,
  the lines, the details of a material, a memory, in the darkroom of inner
  vision. Trying to hold together the fragments of a being, of a body, of a self
  through a vague shape, with a somnambulant sigh; the eye hovering on images
  like a hand lingering just above the skin of an other.


  Through varying approaches – found footage (the memories of others) and self-portraiture (the dissection of a person) – I try to sculpt layers of time, space & material into moments, trapping them into the relentless repetition of a gif, ad nauseam, weighing heavy on the eye. 


  Moments made up from shards of experiences and manipulated paper scraps are glued together, frame by frame, in an improbable media format. Unlike a fixed slice of time, a still image, gifs fill up an interval of time. These tiny moments are experienced in their process, evading a completive experience in one single instant. They are always the same, and yet, each iteration is experienced as a slight variation on the loop before, with different details occupying the viewer’s gaze. Infinitely circling, they never amount to a narrative resolution. Infinitely circling, they fall out of time.
