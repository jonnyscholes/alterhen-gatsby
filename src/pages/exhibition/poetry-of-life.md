  Liza Kulagina (b. 1991, Moscow, Russia). Liza is a Russian artist who works
  with acrylic paints on canvas on the themes of everyday life.

  «Acrylic is my paint of choice because it suits my painting technique, which mirrors the speed of life itself. 

  Life is like a fast series of photoshoots made with blinks of your own eyes. Like so are my paintings: they are what my eyes see in a particular second before and after each blink.
   
  My paintings are the poetry of life that consists of simple things and cozy moments. 
   
  One other motif that unites my work is the expression of emotions through vibrant colors. 
   
  This is also connected to the fast speed theme: we feel so many emotions in each moment, they are differently bright, every emotion has its color and it always varies at each step of my way».
