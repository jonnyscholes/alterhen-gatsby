statement: 'Photogrammetric models of remnants on a clear-cut - a former forest
  that fell victim to climate change - are the departure points for a string of
  works relating to ecological grief. There’s a devastating poetry connected to
  these type of photography-based digital models: they resemble isolated ruins,
  simultaneously brand new and in decay. They’re neither here nor there, these
  ghosts that only echo their physical origins in a digital void.'

  The works of Alexandra Crouwers (The Netherlands, º1974) arise in the x, y and
  z axes of her virtual studio. There, she builds designs for woven tapestries
  and wallpaper, digital dioramas, and boundless sets for video installations.
  Her multi-faceted practice addresses deep concerns about ecological collapse,
  and our detached relation to wilderness. Like an expert time-traveler Crouwers
  shuttles between deep history and the far future, using literature, cinema,
  evolutionary biology and contemporary visual culture as companions. 


  Alexandra lives and works in Antwerp (Belgium) and is currently working on a PhD in arts in animation at Leuven University/LUCA School of Arts, Brussels. Her research is focused on dealing with ecological grief in relation to a ‘real world’ location: a former family forest that had to be cleared due to a climate-change related bark beetle infestation. “Until recently, I would describe escapism as my core-business, and science-fiction as my genre. Due to the upheaval of a virus and a growing public awareness of the severity of our ecological crises, my work has inadvertently shifted to activism.” 


  Crouwers graduated at the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam in 2001. Film screenings include Uppsala Short Film Festival, Transmediale (Berlin), Portable Film Festival (Sydney/Melbourne), and Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival (UK). Exhibitions include S.M.A.K. Museum (Ghent, B), and Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains (Tourcoing, FR).

      Loop based on a photogrammetric model of three tree stumps at The Plot
      (September 2020, 51° 24‘ 49.8” N - 5° 39‘ 19.9” E). 

      Three tree stumps were left for birds to sit on after a small forest - now called 'The Plot' - was cleared due to a climate change induced fatal spruce bark beetle infestation. The stumps resemble a monument, and are treated as such; they're being 'charged' with emblems and plaquettes related to The Plot's demise.

      Loop based on a photogrammetric model of three tree stumps at The Plot
      (May 2021, 51° 24‘ 49.8” N - 5° 39‘ 19.9” E). 

      Three tree stumps were left for birds to sit on after a small forest - now called 'The Plot' - was cleared due to a climate change induced fatal spruce bark beetle infestation. The stumps resemble a monument, and are treated as such; they're being 'charged' with emblems and plaquettes related to The Plot's demise, and are encircled with a wood wall.

      The top of one of the stumps is the face of ecological grief (top right). In the background: the letter 'P' in Ips typography (a font based on spruce bark beetle tunnel patterns).

      ‘Fundamental Mechanics’ is a series in 52 chapters. The ultrashort
      animations were made in 2019 on a mediocre iPhone using the Instagram
      stories feature while researching 16th-century visual culture. The emblema
      were constructed from prefab components such as emojis and stickers, some
      designed by myself for a now-defunct Giphy account.
