title: "[Sic] 1  Là où nous sommes"
statement: >-
  The «[Sic]» series is the result of the reception of another artist’s work, a
  collaborative quote of the initial artwork.


  This research was initiated during an art residency for a physical theatre play, «Là où nous sommes» (Where we stand), created and performed by Charlotte Braun. The play deals with the questions emerging while we are walking alone in nature. These photographs are a proposal seeking to capture the attentive slowing down present in the subject of the piece, but also inherent to any work of research and creation.


  Since nothing is added to the image afterwards, photography can thus in this case serve both as a faithful object to the work cited and also as a testimony of the transition between the viewer’s gaze and the object observed.


  The project is currently continued with living arts companies or artists performing.

  Natalianne is mainly interested in representing perception of time, working on
  the balance between its individual and universal aspects. She uses
  complementary dynamics and media, from landscape with photography and drawing
  to the use of performative, expressive or musical body with video and
  animation. Time subject often reveals in her work themes such as memory, the
  inanimate, loneliness and otherness. 


  Her dance video «Continuum» mixing video and animation was exhibited during group show «Appareiller» at Palais de Tolyo, Paris (2015) and festivals (Mecal, Arte Video Night, Cinemafest Mexico / San Francisco Dance Film Fest (...).


  Natalianne became acquainted with dance and physical theatre as videographer and performer. She also worked at «Le Journal de la photographie» where she met musical artist Atau Tanaka, director of EAVI laboratory, Goldsmiths University of London. She met there Patrick Tresset who’s artworks using robotics about human drawing processes influenced her as well. Around 2017, she worked at BUF Paris as VFX artist (Twin Peaks, Blade Runner, music videos). In 2020, she directed «The Blame» animated music video for Bob Moses.


  Since 2021 she has been working on photographs within natural desertic areas, questionning what is seen and projected from our human point of view when looking at a landscape.


  She graduated from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (Ensad), Paris, in animation cinema (2012)
