  Human Study #1, Hong Kong series is based on a performance recorded during the
  solo show part of artunchained at Artistree in Taikoo place, produced and
  curated by Lisa Botos and sponsored by Swire. Due to COVID restrictions, the
  exhibition was not opened to the public, so professional actors performed, and
  a video artwork was generated and streamed in real-time. This series features
  Ho Yan Lam Grace as the sitter.


  Human Study#1, is an installation where the human becomes an actor. In a scene reminiscent of a life drawing class, the human takes the sitter's role to be sketched by a number of robots. When the subject arrives by appointment, he is seated in an armchair. An assistant attaches sheets of paper onto the robots’ desks and wakes each one up, twisting its arm or knocking three times. 


  The robots, stylised minimal artists, are only capable of drawing obsessively. Their bodies are old school desks on which the drawing paper is pinned. Their left arms bolted on the table, are only able to draw. The robots, named RNP-n all look alike. Their eyes focus on the subject or look at the drawing in progress. 


  The drawing sessions last 15 min, during which time the human cannot see the drawings in progress. The sitter only sees the robots alternating between observing and drawing, sometimes pausing. The sounds produced by each robot’s motors create an improvised soundtrack. 


  Human Study #1, 5 RNP  was premiered at the Merge festival in association with Tate Modern in London in 2012, it has since been exhibited in numerous locations including at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Arts (Seoul) at Ars Electronica 2014 (Linz), BOZAR (Brussels), Variation (Paris), BIAN (Montreal), Japan Media Festival (Kyoto),  Update_5 (Ghent) where it was awarded the Prix du Public and 3rd Prix du Jury, it was also awarded the Bronze Lumen Prize, part of the jury selection at the Japan media festival. The smaller version 3RNP has been extensively exhibited around the world.

  Patrick Tresset is a Brussels-based artist who, in his work, explores human
  traits and the aspects of human experience. His work reflects recurrent ideas
  such as embodiment, passing time/time passing, childhood, conformism,
  obsessiveness, nervousness, the need for storytelling, and mark-making. He is
  best known for his performative installations using robotic agents as stylized
  actors that make marks and for his exploration of the drawing practice using
  computational systems and robots.


  In his late 30s, after working as a painter for 15 years, he attended Goldsmiths College, London, for a master’s degree and then an MPhil in arts and computational technologies. Aside from his artistic practice, in 2013, he was a senior visiting research fellow at Konstanz University and is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Canberra. His past research work is referenced in more than a hundred academic publications in various fields (computational graphics, drawing, psychology, AI, robotics).


  Since 2011, his work has been exhibited in solo and group shows, including in association with major museums such as; The Pompidou Center (Paris), Prada Foundation (Milan), Tate Modern (London), V&A, MMCA (Seoul), The Grand Palais (Paris), BOZAR (Brussels), TAM (Beijing), Mcam (Shanghai), Mori Museum (Tokyo). In  2015 a monograph with seven essays; Human Traits and the Art of Creative Machines, about Patrick’s work was published by the Centre for Contemporary Art Laznia, edited by Ryszard W. Kluszczyńs. His drawings are in a large number of small private collections and in more significant ones, including the V&A (London), Guerlain Foundation (Paris), McaM (Shanghai) and Maison d’ailleurs (Yverdon, CH).  His installations have been awarded prizes and distinctions (Lumens, Ars Electronica, NTAA, Japan Media festival) . His works have featured in numerous media, including;  Art press, Art review,  Beaux art, Frieze, Arte, Form,  Wired, Vice, BBC, DeWelle, Le monde, New York Times.
