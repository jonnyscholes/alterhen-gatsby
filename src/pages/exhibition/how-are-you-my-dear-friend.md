title: How Are You, My Dear Friend?
statement: >-
  The works presented at the exhibition open a series of the artist's first
  digital sculptures made using 3D technology and animation. They consist of
  mechanisms, unexpected constructions and details, living objects, toys. Their
  movement is always looped in themselves, repeating again and again. Such
  themes as game, memory, time, illusions, mutations, absurdity are important
  for Tanya Akhmetgaliyeva's works. 

  Juicy colors beckon and hypnotize, enticing into the fairy-tale worlds of endless phantoms and strange dreams.

      Your Step, I Miss My Step

      2022

      MP4, 1920 x 1920, 6’’


      I'm out of time again. Our times are different. Your time moves smoothly and thoughtfully, while mine moves in leaps and bounds, with abrupt pauses, gaps, failures. We have this habit - to live each moment to the last, burn everything to the ground, do not make plans, do not wait for tomorrow. After all, everyone knows there is no tomorrow. Nothing will happen. And while the wheel of life revolves - dance and don't stop.

      Neither Wind Nor Fire

      Click after click, spark, lightning, rustle, clatter. It's not long before dawn. Someone is dotting the road map. The wheel of the day will creak and start moving soon. Don't touch the flowers and look better at the sky when the motion begins again.

      How Are You, My Dear Friend?

      2022

      MP4, 1080 x 1920, 20’’


      What are you doing now? How is your magical garden? It's snowing somewhere today, again. Voices behind the wall: little words, big words, great importance, and hollowness of words. Can you hear me? My soul is a fragile overflowing fountain, but I can't wake up yet. My words turn to stone and sink, and I send you warm winds, good dreams, two magical dolphins, and a tiny seed of mystery from my heart.
