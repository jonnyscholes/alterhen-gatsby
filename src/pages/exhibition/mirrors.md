statement: >-
  At the beginning of any relationship with someone else, long-term or
  short-term, we trap our reflections and copy that someone else as best we can,
  borrowing their attractive traits of behavior, appearance, and obtaining
  ourselves out of those traits. We do this to the point where we begin to
  reject and define ourselves as another being, and separate traits under the
  natural pressure of time.


  The references for this project were the song "I'll be your mirror" by The Velvet Underground, and the movie "Persona" (1966, directed by Ingmar Bergman). Both of these works became something I wanted to associate my art with until I began to reject and distance myself from these aesthetic qualities, not by choice, but by the coincidence of the time and circumstances.
