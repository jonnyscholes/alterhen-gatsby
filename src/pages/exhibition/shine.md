  SOMATICBITS shares a vision of how photons could interact in a different
  environment. 

  Interacting and creating new combinations of colors and light, shining through the spatial vacuum.

  Dancing and revealing their hidden energy in ways never seen before.

  David Pettersson, also known as SOMATIC BITS, is a digital artist working on
  interactive, immersive and generative artworks. A graphic designer turned
  creative coder, his works are trying to touch the psyche of the viewer.
  Immersing and engulfing anyone willing to get swept away into a world of his
  own. Making the reality twist around, and leave a permanent trace upon the
  mind of whoever sees his pieces. 


  From simplistic monochrome to hyper-detailed colourful artworks, he never stops trying to find ways to express his vision of life and has a constant flow of ideas and creativity. Life is made for experimenting - and it transpires into his creations.
