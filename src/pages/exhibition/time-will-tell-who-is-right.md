artist: Dmitry Gutov
title: "Time Will Tell Who is Right "
statement: >-
  Dmitry Gutov actively employs the technique of visual citation in his work.
  The artist appropriates recognisable images from the history of Art, Russian
  icon painting, oriental calligraphy, creating new "interpretations" of them.

  Text often holds a central place in his works – a quote from classical literature or a common phrase taken from life resonate and are relevant today.
