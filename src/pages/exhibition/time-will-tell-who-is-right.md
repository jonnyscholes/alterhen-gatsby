title: "Time Will Tell Who is Right "
statement: >-
  Dmitry Gutov actively employs the technique of visual citation in his work.
  The artist appropriates recognisable images from the history of Art, Russian
  icon painting, oriental calligraphy, creating new "interpretations" of them.

  Text often holds a central place in his works – a quote from classical literature or a common phrase taken from life resonate and are relevant today.

  Alexander Kosolapov (b. 1943, Moscow, Russia)  is an American-Russian artist
  known for his sculptures and paintings which conflate symbols of American
  consumerism with those from the Soviet Union and Russian Orthodox Church. As
  in his 1982 painting Lenin and Coca-Cola, in which Kosolapov juxtaposed a
  portrait of Vladimir Lenin alongside the iconic Coca-Cola slogan. “I was
  always drawn to social and informational products. I like posters,
  advertisements, comics, political slogans,” he has said. “I use the shared
  language of modern mass culture, addressed to an anonymous viewer.” Born on
  January 1, 1943, Moscow, Russia, Kosolapov attended the Stroganov Art School
  in his hometown alongside fellow student Leonid Sokov. In 1975, the artist
  emigrated to the United States where he helped gather materials for the
  underground Soviet art magazine A-YA and was introduced to the works of Andy
  Warhol. Kosolapov currently lives and works in New York, NY. Today, the
  artist’s works are held in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art in New
  York, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and the State Tretyakov Gallery in
  Moscow, among others.
