title: Beyond the boundaries of time
statement: >-
  World after the war. We will forever remember the world of nowadays in two
  parts: before and after. Terrible events draw their boundaries on the map of
  time. Our time is becoming a territory in which different opinions, conspiracy
  theories, propaganda, and the feelings of ordinary people are fighting on
  different sides. I have always dreamed of stopping time through photography.
  Now I dream of returning humanity to a territory where there have been no
  terrible events yet. Beyond the boundaries of time.


  Film photography from personal archive post-war Abkhazia in 2007, boundaries 2022. Original pieces by  Katya Kanke
