title: Translating William Blake
statement: >-
  Reimagining of William Blake’s ‘Illustrations of the Book of Job’.


  Ongoing series of 21 artworks to mirror Blake’s original publication, imbuing the strange content of Blake's life, ego and beliefs, and the poetry of the illustrations, into a modern, visual translation, exploring the evolution of belief and how that is transformed in the digital age.


  All images are digital sculptures / digital paintings, in my signature style of error as inherent truth.

description: >-
  My works across various media, mostly digital sculptural processes followed by
  painted treatments, are an ongoing investigation into the artistic
  possibilities of error and uncertainty, as a way of mirroring the mysterious,
  counter-intuitive aspects of the quantum world. This world is a place in which
  ambiguity and a lack of precision are fundamental to an eventual accuracy
  orders of magnitude higher than we are accustomed. 


  It can be seen as an attempt to accept a ‘failure’ of classical exactitude in aesthetics, as a way of seeking a deeper understanding of the human perception of the world, particularly as that perception modulates in extreme contexts.


  The aim is to achieve an end product that is, or at least seems, right by wielding the power of wrong, and in doing so, glory in this ‘failure’ because it perfectly represents the human experience of the world vs the true quantum reality enabling it.
