  Patrick Tresset is a Brussels-based artist who, in his work, explores human
  traits and the aspects of human experience. His work reflects recurrent ideas
  such as embodiment, passing time/time passing, childhood, conformism,
  obsessiveness, nervousness, the need for storytelling, and mark-making. He is
  best known for his performative installations using robotic agents as stylized
  actors that make marks and for his exploration of the drawing practice using
  computational systems and robots.


  In his late 30s, after working as a painter for 15 years, he attended Goldsmiths College, London, for a master’s degree and then an MPhil in arts and computational technologies. Aside from his artistic practice, in 2013, he was a senior visiting research fellow at Konstanz University and is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Canberra. His past research work is referenced in more than a hundred academic publications in various fields (computational graphics, drawing, psychology, AI, robotics).


  Since 2011, his work has been exhibited in solo and group shows, including in association with major museums such as; The Pompidou Center (Paris), Prada Foundation (Milan), Tate Modern (London), V&A, MMCA (Seoul), The Grand Palais (Paris), BOZAR (Brussels), TAM (Beijing), Mcam (Shanghai), Mori Museum (Tokyo). In  2015 a monograph with seven essays; Human Traits and the Art of Creative Machines, about Patrick’s work was published by the Centre for Contemporary Art Laznia, edited by Ryszard W. Kluszczyńs. His drawings are in a large number of small private collections and in more significant ones, including the V&A (London), Guerlain Foundation (Paris), McaM (Shanghai) and Maison d’ailleurs (Yverdon, CH).  His installations have been awarded prizes and distinctions (Lumens, Ars Electronica, NTAA, Japan Media festival) . His works have featured in numerous media, including;  Art press, Art review,  Beaux art, Frieze, Arte, Form,  Wired, Vice, BBC, DeWelle, Le monde, New York Times.
