artist: Bernardo Liu
title: Shortcuts
statement: The "Shortcuts" exhibition comes from a series of physical
  paper-cutting works made by the artist. Inspired by the popular culture of
  paper cutting in China, "Shortcuts" brings the artist's imagery represented by
  his memories in Brazil, experiencing and mixing with the language of oriental
  paper cut-outs.

  Bernardo Liu is a plastic artist from Rio de Janeiro. As a descendant of
  Orientals, his artistic research explores intersections between both cultures.
  Possible places of collision, such as symbols, feelings, or habits. An imagery
  repertoire arises from these perceptions of ancestry that blend with layers of
  realities that cross the artist, resulting In his paintings, drawings,
  papercuts and now NFT's. 


  "Differences become affective aesthetic bodies (work), as possible ways of distributing love and understanding." - Edmilson Nunes
