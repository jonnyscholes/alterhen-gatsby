title: X-ray
statement: >-
  Raw X-ray images lose their original function to be showed as artistic pieces.

  The originals have not been manipulated, in some cases just reframed, entrusting all the work to the machine, time and chance.

  First selection from among more than 7000 vet X-ray images assigned to the artist.
