title: The subliminal ghosts series
statement: 'The "Subliminal ghosts series" is a collection of moving images
  depicting otherwordly apparitions which are taking over mental landscapes.
  Blending the mystical and supernatural with state-of-the-art
  computer-generated images, these animated pieces question the grey line
  between human spirituality and the advancement of technology. What if ghosts
  can emerge from the rise of artificial intelligence? Ectoplasms of mysterious
  digital simulations weave a layered lucid dream. '
