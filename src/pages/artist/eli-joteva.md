title: Chtonic Light
statement: Inspired by fermentation cycles in wine-making, the project "Chtonic
  Light" transforms decaying matter into digital light. In each NFT of this
  series, 3D scans of grapes decompose and regrow digitally. What new light/life
  forms can our contemporary tools birth?
