title: The Plot
statement: "Photogrammetric models of remnants on a clear-cut - a former forest
  that fell victim to climate change - are the departure points for a string of
  works relating to ecological grief. There’s a devastating poetry connected to
  these type of photography-based digital models: they resemble isolated ruins,
  simultaneously brand new and in decay. They’re neither here nor there, these
  ghosts that only echo their physical origins in a digital void."
