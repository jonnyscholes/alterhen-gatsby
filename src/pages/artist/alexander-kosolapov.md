name: Alexander Kosolapov
bio: Since the mid-â€˜70s Alexander Kosolapov was one of the key figures of social
  art, painter, graphic artist, sculptor. Works are based on an ironically
  radical combination of recognizable symbols and stereotypes of Soviet ideology
  and global mass culture. By playing with images, the artist debunks both the
  political Soviet myth-making, as well as the capitalist fetishism of
  commodities. Works are in the MOMA New York, the Tretyakov Gallery, the
  Russian Museum, and other public and private collections
