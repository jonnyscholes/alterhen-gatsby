title: Mmmmultiplicityyyyy
statement: "Mmmmultiplicityyyyy examines the evolution of the American colonial
  gaze and how their conceptions of Filipinos have shifted from savage - to
  subordinate - to friend, more than 70 years after the World's Fair in 1904. It
  features local practices that are influenced by more than 300 years of Spanish
  and American rule. "
