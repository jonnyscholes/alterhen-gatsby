title: City Scapes
statement: >-
  The city, to me, is more than mere physical space. It is, in many ways, an
  ever-changing system that, just as a generative algorithm, takes on countless
  different shapes while remaining the same at its core.


  City Scapes is a series that, through a generative algorithm, explores human perception in the context of the cities we live in. The series is the result of an ongoing experimentation inspired by abstract expressionism and the textures of tapestry.
