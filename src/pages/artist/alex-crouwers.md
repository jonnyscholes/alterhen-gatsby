statement: >-
  ‘Fundamental Mechanics’ relates to the motions of mechanical looms. This
  72-part series of miniature animations was made while I was researching
  16th-century European visual culture for the production of three monumental
  Gobelin tapestries, woven at the renowned Textile Museum of Tilburg (The
  Netherlands). 


  While designing the tapestries, I started exploring animation techniques using consumer technology. With the Instagram Stories feature on my old iPhone, I constructed rebus-like 'emblema', inspired by 16th-century alchemic emblem books. These ultra-short works combine emoji and .gif stickers pulled from the Giphy platform, including my own, now defunct, Giphy artist account, which accumulated over 195 million views in just 9 months.


  'Fundamental Mechanics' is a suggestive and effective series exploring non-linearity, non-spaces, portals, choices, and cognition, weaving a bridge across 500 years of art history.
