title: Faces from Energy Blocks series
statement: Adept of the quantum thought of the materialization of thoughts and
  the creation of her own reality in a multiverse of possibilities, she goes
  searching for her treasures in the midst of urban chaos, collecting and
  gathering them.  Transforming them into objects of power, trophies, symbols
  that she displays as a surviving warrior in a dystopian world.  (Walter Nomura
