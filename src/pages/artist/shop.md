statement: >-
  We believe the potential of NFTs is profound for the cultural economy. It is
  also here to stay. a\terHEN aims to experiment with alternative models for
  this new world, and to empower artists in a sustainable system that benefits
  all. The new art space is an open market, of quality, accessible to all and
  affordable. The concept of NFT’s, that of enabling digital artworks to be
  owned and shared, has created a transformatively new and vibrant space that
  allows art lovers who may have had no previous connection with the art market
  to participate. By embracing its full potential, cultural actors can benefit
  from a new and attractive market to generate new sources of revenue.


  The borderless, decentralised nature of NFTs enables artists from a broader range of society and geographical locations to be involved and allows room for exploration of the often overlooked ethical values of diversity, inclusion and environmental awareness. alterHEN also aims to encourage art institutions, curators and collectors to become involved.


  The a\terHEN space is organised by a diverse group of established and emergent artists who met on the eco-friendly, NFT platform Hic et Nunc. We aim to celebrate the potential of this lively, experimental platform, but also provide a space to allow a more meaningful appreciation of artists and their works.


  We also act as a conduit for accessing the works directly on the blockchain, along with some helpful advice on how to take part for those with no prior knowledge of the process.


  The name alterHEN is inspired by “altermodern”

  Altermodern, a portmanteau word defined by Nicolas Bourriaud, is an attempt at contextualizing art made in today's global context as a reaction against standardisation and commercialism.
